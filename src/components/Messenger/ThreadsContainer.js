/*
SOME EXPLANATION AND TIPS ABOUT USING CONNECT

// This is the simplest way to connect our component to the store.dispatch method
// and probably not the best
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
  dispatch
})

// We can also connect directly an action with dispatch by doing this.
// This is nice because you provide the component just with the actions it can dispatch
// You might think that it's maybe a lot of typing, and you might be right.
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
  dispatchReceiveThread: thread => {
    dispatch(actions.receiveThread(thread))
  }
})

// Then instead of this
this.props.dispatch(actions.receiveThread(thread))
// we can simply do this
this.props.dispatchReceiveThread(thread)
// It helps get the best of the previous ones:
// Not much typing, and we just provide to the component the actions it can dispatch
const mapDispatchToProps = {
  dispatchReceiveThread: actions.receiveThread
}

// try to use the last one :)
